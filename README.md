Introduction:
Event Driven Systems are one of the modern architectural patterns for achieving scalability. Its not trivial to create a completely event driven system and also it not useful in every system you create. Events are useful in some particular kind of systems only. Micro-services is one of the use case to take advantage of Events. We are starting a series of assignments called "Event Chase". Event Chase is a series of multiple small-2 problems to make everyone learn and get better at designing event driven systems. We will get a chance to look at some patterns as well as anti patterns during the course of these assignments. 
Technologies we are going to learn in this assignment: 
1. Spring Boot
2. Rabbit MQ
Problem Statement 1: 
Purpose: To generate an event as a message and pass it to a broker system. You are learning "Event-Carried State Transfer" this way. If more interested, read first 2 heading of https://martinfowler.com/articles/201701-event-driven.html
Problem: Suppose you have two micro services. 
1. Service 1: Responsible to Generating Events
2. Service 2: Responsible fo Receiving Events
3. Rabbit MQ: For transferring the message from Service 1 to Service 2
Use Cases 1: 
Service 1: 
1. Create an api accepting the below JSON as an Object.
```json
{
  "orderId" : "adfafdafafdasfas",
  "products" : [{
    "name" : "abc" ,
    "price" : 1010
  },
  {
    "name" : "abc1" ,
    "price" : 10101
  }],
  "receipient" : {
    "basicProfile" : {
        "name" : "",
        "phoneNumber" : "",
        "email" : ""
    },
    "addresses" : [{
        "addressType" : "billing",
        "line1" : "",
        "line2" : "",
        "city" : "",
        "state" : "",
        "country" : ""
    },{
        "addressType" : "delivery",
        "line1" : "",
        "line2" : "",
        "city" : "",
        "state" : "",
        "country" : ""
    }]
  }
}
```
2. Send the above message to a topic exchange. You can name is whatever you want. 
Service 2:
1. Create a listener in service 2. This listener should be able to receive message from the above topic exchange. 
2. I am assuming you will figure out how to add queue to a listener using GOOGLE SEARCH.
3. Just print the message to the log together with the queue name and routing key. 
Use Cases 2: 
Service 1: 
1. Create another api accepting the same JSON as an Object.
```json
{
  "orderId" : "adfafdafafdasfas",
  "products" : [{
    "name" : "abc" ,
    "price" : 1010
  },
  {
    "name" : "abc1" ,
    "price" : 10101
  }],
  "receipient" : {
    "basicProfile" : {
        "name" : "",
        "phoneNumber" : "",
        "email" : "",
    },
    "addresses" : [{
        "addressType" : "billing",
        "line1" : "",
        "line2" : "",
        "city" : "",
        "state" : "",
        "country" : ""
    },{
        "addressType" : "delivery",
        "line1" : "",
        "line2" : "",
        "city" : "",
        "state" : "",
        "country" : ""
    }]
  }
}
```
2. Send the above message to a direct exchange. You can name is whatever you want. 
Service 2:
1. Create a new listener in service 2. This listener should be able to receive message from the above direct exchange. 
2. I am assuming you will figure out how to add queue to a listener using GOOGLE SEARCH.
3. Just print the message to the log. Together with the queue name. 
Use Cases 3: 
Service 1: 
1. Create another api accepting the same JSON as an Object.
```json
{
  "orderId" : "adfafdafafdasfas",
  "products" : [{
    "name" : "abc" ,
    "price" : 1010
  },
  {
    "name" : "abc1" ,
    "price" : 10101
  }],
  "receipient" : {
    "basicProfile" : {
        "name" : "",
        "phoneNumber" : "",
        "email" : "",
    },
    "addresses" : [{
        "addressType" : "billing",
        "line1" : "",
        "line2" : "",
        "city" : "",
        "state" : "",
        "country" : ""
    },{
        "addressType" : "delivery",
        "line1" : "",
        "line2" : "",
        "city" : "",
        "state" : "",
        "country" : ""
    }]
  }
}
```
2. Send the above message to a Fanout exchange. You can name is whatever you want. 
Service 2:
1. Create 3 new listener in service 2. All should be able to receive message from the above Fanout Exchange. 
2. I am assuming you will figure out how to add queue to a listener using GOOGLE SEARCH.
3. Just print the message to the log. Together with the current queue name


`docker build -f Dockerfile -t bowlerindocker .`

`docker pull rabbitmq`

```docker run -d \
   --name="rabbitmq" \
   -p "4369:4369" \
   -p "5671:5671" \
   -p "5672:5672" \
   -p "15671:15671" \
   -p "15672:15672" \
   rabbitmq:3-management
```
`docker run --name=mysqlindocker -d mysql/mysql-server`

`docker logs mysqlindocker` and get the generated password from there

`docker exec -it mysqlindocker mysql -uroot -p`
Enter the password that you got in the logs.

`mysql> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'ueducation';`

`docker run -p 8080:8080 bowler`

`docker run -p 8081:8080 bowler`
